# Hexchat Vintage

This is my fork of hexchat containing fixes and patches of interest to me (piusbird). If you like this and want to help good.

If you don't then well don't use it. This will be very conservative at first. Only accepting patches that fix stability issues, or to keep up with gtk changes. I hope to add some quality of life improvements, as time allows.

No i will not revert the pokemon inspired join/part/quit messages patch. Computers should be fun, thank you very much.
